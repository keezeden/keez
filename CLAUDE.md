# Keez's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio I will use to start my brand image, find new clients and be the hub of anything and everything I do or create.

## Design Specifications

There are reference images for the styles I like, they can be found in `/references`

- `mockup.png` is a rough vibe and feel i want in to website. High contract black and white with some added accent colors, im thinking purple. The art and extra background shapes dont need to be added, but I like the product mockups in the referenced work, just not in cards but free floating - maybe in a list view instead
